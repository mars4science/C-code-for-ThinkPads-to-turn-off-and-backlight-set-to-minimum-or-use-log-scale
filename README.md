stopfan and night : for the purpose to build exec files, put them in $PATH and grant them right to run as superuser by `sudo chmod +xs /path/execname` 

The inspiration for stopfan is to be able to quickly silence the laptop, for night - to be able to set minimum brightness and be able to change on logarithmic scale.
